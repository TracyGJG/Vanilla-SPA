# Vanilla-SPA

## Single Page Application written in vanilla JavaScript

Inspired by the [article by Santiago Garc√≠a da Rosa](https://medium.com/frontend-fun/js-vanilla-script-spa-1b29b43ea475) with the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/SantiagoGdaR/vanilla-spa).

Variations from the orginal project include:

- Default route identified outside of the array of routes.
- Semantic markup employed using an adaptive application layout.
- Fetch API employed to retrieve vaiews in place of XHR.
- Views/Routes include navigable (menu driven) panels as well as named areas (aside).
- Navigation/Menu generated from selected routes.
- Vanilla CSS used to apply layout and colour scheme, using custom properties.
- Dynamic sizing of an 'aside' panel.

### Changes Planned

- Template used to generate navigation entries.
- Use JS (ES) modules for the JavaScript files.
